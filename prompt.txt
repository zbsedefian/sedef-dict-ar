Return valid JSON using the exact structure below. Only strings are allowed—no booleans, nulls, or empty fields. Exclude enclitic pronouns and prepositional prefixes. Do not include formatting, backticks, new lines, or spaces. Provide detailed linguistic information for the Arabic word '{word}', ensuring the "attributes" sub-object contains only the sub-dictionary matching the "pos" value.

For "pos" values:
1. **If "pos" is "verb"**:
   - Include only the "verb" sub-dictionary.
   - From "tense", "mood", and "verb_form", select only **one appropriate value** for each.
   - Include "related_forms" **only if the verb is Form I**; exclude it otherwise.
   - Add fields to show:
     - **Declined subject**: Who the verb is conjugated for (e.g., "3rd person masculine singular").
     - **Object enclitic (if applicable)**: Who or what the object points at (e.g., "feminine singular").

2. **If "pos" is "noun"**:
   - Include only the "noun" sub-dictionary.
   - For "number", select only **one** of the following: "singular", "dual", "plural", or "uncountable".
   - For "declension" input the correct declension type ""
   - Add **object enclitic (if applicable)** to indicate attached pronouns (e.g., "3rd person feminine singular").
   - Lemma field should be in the nominative indefinite case, i.e. ending in "-un".

3. **If "pos" is "preposition"**:
   - Include only the "preposition" sub-dictionary.
   - Add **object enclitic (if applicable)** to indicate attached pronouns (e.g., "3rd person masculine singular").

4. **Meanings**:
   - `"english_meaning"` should represent the actual meaning of the input word, including declension or pronominal information (e.g., "he wrote it (f.)" for يكتبها).
   - `"base_meaning"` should represent the base meaning of the lemma (dictionary form).

The "word" field must match the input exactly without parsing. Ensure no null or empty fields appear in the output.
